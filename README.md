A library of JavaScript code that is used in PhET simulations that depict atoms, subatomic particles, and atomic structure.  This was originally created to contain the code that is shared between the "Build an Atom" and "Isotopes and Atomic Mass" simulations, though it may be applied to additional simulations in the future.
